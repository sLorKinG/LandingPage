### Hello, I am Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions and loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son. Husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently procrastinating creating this
-ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on either programming oriented or music projects.
-ðŸ’¬ Ask me about literally anything, i'll google it beforehand and reply to you
-ðŸ“« How to reach me: git gud
-âš¡ Fun fact: this document is a creation of a totally original and authentic idea and surely not a blatant copy of the first youtube video that I saw after typing "how to make your github profile look good" (and totally not cringe)
