### 👋Hi there! I'm a passionate student in Applied Informatics, Computer Science, and Technology at the University of Macedonia. 

●🎓 Currently, I'm diving deep into the core concepts of data engineering, mathematical programming, operations research  and deep learning.

●🎵 My interests include guitar playing, songwriting, fantasy storytelling, and marathon running
  

 ●👯  I’m looking to collaborate on ground-breaking, jaw-dropping, billion-dollar projects that, I'm sure, no one else has thought of before.
  

 ●⚡ Fun fact: this document is a creation of a <em>totally original and authentic idea</em> and surely not a blatant copy of the first YouTube video titled "How to make your GitHub profile look good". Trust me, I checked. Twice.
