### I’m currently procrastinating creating this.


●🎓I'm studying Applied Informatics, Computer Science and Technology. 

●🔐I'm interested in Web development, Mobile development, Algorithms and Data science.

●👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ground-breaking ,jaw-dropping ,billin-dollar projects that I'm sure no one else have thought of this before.

●💬 Ask me about anything. I'll google it beforehand and probably forget to reply .

●⚡ Fun fact: this document is a creation of a totally original and authentic idea and surely not a blatant copy of the first youtube video that I saw after typing "how to make your github profile look good" (and totally not cringe)
